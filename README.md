# 3D-Modelling-and-mixed-reality-applications-project
Indie game using Unity

1. Description of the project topic

1.1 What?

It is a 3D game where the player can control the movement using the arrow keys and spacebar for jump. The goal of this game is to reach the finish line in the last scene. However, in order to reach the finish line. Player has to collect the key which will allow him/her to teleport to another scene. Along the way there will be a mini challenge before getting the key.

1.2 For whom?

Anyone who wants to play a game and have some fun. It is accessible to audiences of all ages and interests. We design the game for easy to understand and explain to people that have never seen it before. 

1.3 Why?

Creating a Unique and Challenging Gameplay by actively involving the player in an interesting narrative, with a few puzzles to solve along the way and a decent script.
Gameplays contribute to emotional release to improve brain function.

2. Implementation

We start by getting the idea of what we are going to do. We think of “fall guys” which is a multiplayer game, but since that scope might be large for us we limit it to one player. Once we had the idea about “fall guys”, we decided to let each member come up with their own theme. As a result we have 3 themes from 3 members. Each of us then starts with modeling on our scene. It took us one week and a half to finish all of our models. Finally we can start to put our models to unity and make it work. The game was made with Unity. Each of us made the theme work in the way they want it to be. Finally, there is one person who combines all of the scenes together to make the flow work.

2.1 Target platform
All of our development has been targeted at the Windows platform. We need to prepare our project for that. To do so we need to first switch our target platform in Unity. To do this we click File > Build Settings and the window that appears will allow us to change our target platform.

2.2 XR Features

We made a total of 2 different versions of the game, the PC version and the XR feature using Oculus Quest 2. But the XR Feature version has some problems with several bugs. Therefore, it is unable to play completely. The details we find will be discussed in Section 4.
